Project Feedback: MSP430 Command Line Interface

Technical Challenges & Issues:

->Timer Mode Conflicts: A significant issue was encountered during the implementation of the Buzzer::stop() routine. 
Initially, overwriting the TA0CTL register caused system-wide freezes. This was resolved by switching to bitwise 
operations (&= ~MC_3) to surgically halt the timer without disrupting the clock source (TASSEL).

->Asynchronous State Management: Managing the hand-off between the Main Loop and the Timer ISR required careful use of 
the volatile keyword. Without this, the compiler optimized away state changes (like isPlaying), leading to logic hangs.

->Memory Bounds: Handling melody arrays required strict boundary checks to prevent the "Off-By-One" errors that previously 
caused CPU crashes when a song reached its final note.

Positive Remarks:

->Multitasking Success: The transition from a blocking for-loop architecture to a non-blocking Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) 
significantly improved the user experience. The CLI remains perfectly responsive while audio is processed in the background.

->Modern C++ Benefits: Implementing a reusable template class, Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) using namespaces and #pragma once proved highly effective. 
It made the code significantly more readable and allowed for rapid debugging of hardware pins without touching the core application logic.

->With this approach i was able to use a version control by building the system ground up in versions , i sincerely enjoyed working 
on this project.
